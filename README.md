# Change in Total Undergraduate Enrollment in Eight Humanities Departments from Spring 2018 to Spring 2019
I downloaded the data from the Harvard Registrar website and used it to compare the total number of students enrolled in classes in eight departments in the humanities, such as The Classics, Comparative Literature, and others, depending on the year.
The Rmd file shows my code with comments and the html file shows the plot. I have also included the two datasets to be able to look at the data.
